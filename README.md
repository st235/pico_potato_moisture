# Soil Moisture Sensor

SMS or Soil Moisture Sensor is a small firmware for your raspberry pi pico board that helps you to keep track of moisture in plants' pots.

### Setup

First of all, you need to build binary for your `pi pico`. Just follow the instructions below to assemble executable for your board:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make .
```

If this step is over then congratulations ðŸ¥³ Now you need to connect your board to pc and copy the `potato_moisture.uf2` file from `build` folder.

### FAQ

**Q**: Why potato?<br>
**A**: [potato mode](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=potato%20mode). Long story short: it is a pretty simple DIY receipt and you can literally assemble it from pico, led board, moisture sensor, and scotch
